The solution involves verifying native module installation and linking, and potentially rebuilding native projects.  For Android, ensure that your Gradle configurations are correct and the native libraries are properly included. For iOS, you might need to run `pod install` and check your Xcode project settings.  Here's an example of how you might attempt to address the issue:

```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const ImageProcessor = NativeModules.ImageProcessor;

if (!ImageProcessor) {
  console.error('Native module ImageProcessor not found! Check your native project configuration.');
} else {
  ImageProcessor.processImage(imageUri)
    .then(result => {
      // ...success handling...
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // ...error handling...
    });
}
```
Also check your native (Android and iOS) project files to ensure the native library is correctly included and compiled.
