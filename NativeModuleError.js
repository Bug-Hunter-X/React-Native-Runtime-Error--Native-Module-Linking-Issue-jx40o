This error occurs when using a library that depends on native modules, and the native modules are not correctly linked or configured for your specific platform (Android or iOS).  This often manifests as a runtime error, not a compile-time error, because the problem only appears when the app tries to load the native module during execution. The error message itself may vary greatly depending on the library and the exact nature of the linking problem.  Common symptoms include an app that crashes on launch or at runtime, or a specific feature fails to work because the necessary native code isn't accessible.
