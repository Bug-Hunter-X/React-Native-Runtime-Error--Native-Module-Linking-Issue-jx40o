This repository demonstrates a common React Native error where native modules fail to link correctly. The example involves a hypothetical library that uses a native module for image processing.  The `NativeModuleError.js` file shows the code that produces the error, while `NativeModuleSolution.js` provides a solution by verifying native module linking and demonstrating proper linking approaches.  This is particularly relevant to projects utilizing libraries dependent upon native modules for their functionality.
